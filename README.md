Assembler: You will need a 6502 assembler to compile the source code. Tools like Turbo Macro Pro or CBM Prg Studio are recommended.
Emulator: If you don't have access to C64 hardware, you can use an emulator like VICE.

Installation

Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/KingHavok/happybird.git
cd happybird

Assemble the Source Code:
